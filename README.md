# Description
This repository contains six data structure projects:
- Lab 1: Check if a sum exists in a list using recursion.
- Lab 2: Check if a sum exists in a list iteratively using a stack.
- Lab 3: Create a Binary Search Tree and AVL (self-balancing Binary Search Tree).
- Lab 4: Implement a solution for Huffman codes.
- Lab 5: Implement a trie abstract data structure.
- Lab 6: Implement own Hash Tables with different collision handling methods: linear probe, double hashing, and separate chaining.

# How to Run

2. Click "Fork & Run". Sign in if necessary.
3. In the Shell, navigate to the appropriate lab folder.
4. Type "python3 Lab<number>-Tester.py", where <number> is between 1 and 6.

# What I Learned
- Understanding critical data structure implementations and concepts such as stack and heap, recursion, Binary Search Tree, Hash table, and hash function, etc.
- Python syntax and fundamentals.
